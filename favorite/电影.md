I think it the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. I hope I can make it across the border.I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope to see my friend, and shake his hand. I hope.

1. Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgement.
